Gasoline prices always is an issue in Turkey; because Turkish people love to drive where they would go but they complain about the prices anyway. I wanted to start digging for the last seven yearsâ€™ prices and how they went. I have used unleaded gasoline 95 octane prices from Petrol Ofisi which is a fuel distribution company in Turkey. I arranged the prices monthly between 2013 and 2020 as the Turkish currency, Lira (TL). The dataset is attached here in this repository[gasoline_df.xlsx]
